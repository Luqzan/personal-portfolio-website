          Here is my story:
        </p>

        <p>My name is Luqzan Ariff,</p>

        <p>Born and raised in Malaysia.</p>

        <p>But I struggled.</p>

        <p>Struggled finding my way.</p>

        <p>Struggled finding my place.</p>

        <p>So, I asked myself:</p>

        <p>&quot;What do I love?&quot;</p>

        <p>&quot;What&apos;s my passion?&quot;</p>

        <p>Then I realized.</p>

        <p>
          Ever since a child, I&apos;ve always been fascinated by technologies.
        </p>

        <p>I love tinkering with toys.</p>

        <p>I love taking things apart and put them back together.</p>

        <p>
          Like the old PlayStation2 my family had that broken down because of
          me.
        </p>

        <p>I love computers.</p>

        <p>When I was 12, I got my first desktop computer.</p>

        <p>I love the adventures of upgrading it.</p>

        <p>Thank you, Linus Tech Tips for inspiring me.</p>

        <p>In pursuit of finding my place in the world,</p>

        <p>I discovered a whole new world of digital development.</p>

        <p>I started learning, and continued grinding, despite all odds.</p>

        <p>Because finally, I&apos;ve found my calling.</p>

        <p>I know that I still have a long journey.</p>

        <p>With you, we can make it a meaningful one.</p>
